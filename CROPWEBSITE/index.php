						<a class="Text1"> Our product is made for martians who want to maintain their crops perfectly.
                            Our product makes sure you keep your crops healthy and it automatically waters your crops.
                            CROP also tells you when to harvest your crops. CROP has a built-in led path to your crops
                            so you don't have to remember where you exactly planted every crop.

		<div id="C2block">
			CROP uses state of the art technology to make growing crops on a planet where nothing grows a hundred times easier.
			Our system uses top notch sensors and actuators to automate your Mars-farming as much as possible.
			<br><br>
			CROP will keep track of the planted crops on things like age, nutrition and hydration.
			This will be shown to the user on a LCD screen. Also, patches of land planted with specific crops will
			be highlighted using LED-lights to indicate which crops are planted where.

		<td class="Producttd3">
			<br><br>

				<a class="Text1"> There are several reasons why our product is the best invention for Martians yet: Our product is a very cheap
					solution for perfecting your farming skills on Mars. Farming is very important on Mars. There is no wild life or liquid water on the surface, therefore
					farming is the only way to survive on Mars. Because our product is fairly simple we are able to sell it for cheap price, but don't underestimate the handiness of
					our product. CROP also doesn't require any hardware or electronics knowledge, the only thing you need to do is install it correctly.
